# The Boomerang Logo

Some weeks ago we at eSailors set up a new team in our Area where I am part of.
We named us 'Team Boomerang' because we our team takes over the responsible of customer retention.

I thought we should come up with an logo too and so I spent my spare time drawing an idea first on paper and designing it with Adobe's Illustrator.

I actually worked the last time with Illustrator during my study time - 20 years ago. What a long time..?!

So, here you can find the outcome.
